## **3. Notes & Tips**

**Scheduling Optimization**

- **Default settings**: New reminders default to 9:00 AM on weekdays (Monday-Friday) for optimal productivity

- **Time selection**: Choose times when you're typically available and motivated to record

- **Day combination strategies**: Mix weekdays and weekends based on your recording routine and content type

- **Multiple reminder coordination**: Stagger different reminders by at least 30 minutes to avoid notification clustering

**Title and Description Guidelines**

- **Character limits**: Titles must be between 2-50 characters for proper display and notification formatting

- **Descriptive naming**: Use specific titles like "Morning Journal," "Meeting Notes," or "Study Session"

- **Context inclusion**: Include purpose or location information for better reminder context

- **Avoid special characters**: Standard text works best for cross-platform notification compatibility

**Technical Considerations**

- **Weekly repetition**: All schedules automatically repeat weekly on selected days

- **Notification timing**: Reminders trigger at the exact specified time with standard system notification sound

- **Permission dependency**: Recording Schedule requires notification permissions to function properly

- **Background processing**: Notifications work even when the app is closed or backgrounded

## **4. FAQ**

**Setup & Permission Issues**

### **The Recording Schedule toggle is disabled or grayed out.\*\***

This indicates notification permissions haven't been granted. To resolve:

1. Go to device Settings → Apps → \[App Name] → Notifications

2. Enable "Allow notifications" for the app

3. Return to the app and access Recording Schedule again

4. The toggle should now be active and functional

---

### **I'm not receiving recording reminder notifications.\*\***

Check these common issues:

- **Permission status**: Verify notifications are enabled in device settings

- **Do Not Disturb**: Ensure your device isn't in Do Not Disturb mode during scheduled times

- **Background app refresh**: Enable background app refresh for the application

- **Battery optimization**: Disable battery optimization for the app to ensure reliable notification delivery

- **Time zone changes**: Manually refresh reminders after traveling across time zones

---

### **The app crashes when I try to create a new reminder.\*\***

This typically indicates:

- Insufficient device memory or storage space

- Outdated app version requiring update

- Conflicts with device notification system

- **Solution**: Restart device, update the app, and ensure adequate storage space

---

**Creation & Editing Issues**

### **I can't save my reminder - the Create button is disabled.\*\***

The Create button requires all mandatory fields to be properly filled:

- **Title validation**: Must be 2-50 characters, cannot be empty or only spaces

- **Day selection**: At least one day of the week must be selected

- **Time setting**: Verify a specific time has been chosen (not default/blank)

- **Character count**: Check title length doesn't exceed 50 characters

---

### **Why can't I select a title with only one character?\*\***

Single-character titles are restricted because:

- They provide insufficient context for effective reminders

- May cause display issues in notification interfaces

- Don't meet minimum descriptive requirements for meaningful reminders

---

### **My reminder title gets cut off in the reminder card.\*\***

Title truncation occurs when:

- Titles exceed display space in compact card format

- Device screen size limitations affect text rendering

- **Solution**: Use concise but descriptive titles (under 20 characters for best display)

- Full titles remain visible in edit dialogs and notifications

---

### **I can't edit the time on an existing reminder.\*\***

Editing restrictions may occur due to:

- Notification permission changes since creation

- App requiring restart after system updates

- **Solution**: Delete and recreate the reminder, or restart the app and try editing again

---

**Scheduling & Timing Issues**

### **Can I set reminders for specific dates instead of recurring weekly schedules?\*\***

Currently, the Recording Schedule only supports weekly recurring patterns. For one-time reminders:

- Create a weekly reminder and delete it after the specific date

- Use device's built-in calendar or reminder apps for one-time events

- Consider creating temporary weekly reminders for short-term projects

---

### **What happens if I change time zones while traveling?\*\***

Recording Schedule uses device local time, so:

- Reminders automatically adjust to new time zone

- Scheduled times remain consistent with device time

- No manual adjustment needed for time zone changes

- Notifications continue at the same local times in the new time zone

---

### **Can I set multiple reminders for the same day at different times?\*\***

Yes, you can create multiple reminders with different times on the same days:

- Each reminder operates independently

- Use descriptive titles to distinguish purposes (e.g., "Morning Prep" vs "Evening Reflection")

- Recommended minimum 30-minute spacing between reminders

---

### **Why do some notifications arrive late or not at all?\*\***

Notification delivery can be affected by:

- **Battery optimization**: Device power-saving features may delay notifications

- **Background app restrictions**: Ensure the app can run in background

- **System notification limits**: Device may throttle frequent notifications

- **Network connectivity**: Poor connection during scheduling can affect notification registration

---

**Management & Organization**

### **How many recording schedules can I create?\*\***

There's no explicit limit mentioned in the app, but practical considerations include:

- Device notification system limitations

- User interface display constraints

- Recommendation: 5-10 reminders for optimal management and effectiveness

---

### **Can I temporarily disable a reminder without deleting it?\*\***

Currently, individual reminders can't be disabled - they must be deleted. For temporary disabling:

- Use the main Recording Schedule toggle to disable all reminders

- Delete and recreate specific reminders when needed

- Consider editing reminder days to exclude unwanted notification days

---

### **Is there a way to see all my upcoming recording reminders in one view?\*\***

The Recording Schedule screen shows all active reminders, but for upcoming schedule preview:

- Reminder cards display selected days and times

- Check device's notification history for recent recording reminders

- Use calendar apps to track recording sessions based on reminder schedules

---

**Technical & Advanced Issues**

### **Do reminders work when the app is closed or my phone is locked?\*\***

Yes, recording reminders use system-level notifications that function:

- When the app is completely closed

- During device lock screen state

- In background or sleep mode

- Independent of app's active status

---

### **What happens to my reminders if I reinstall the app?\*\***

Recording schedules are stored locally, so reinstalling the app will:

- Delete all existing reminder configurations

- Require recreation of all recording schedules

- Reset notification permissions (may need re-authorization)

- **Recommendation**: Note down current schedules before reinstalling

---

### **Can I export or backup my recording schedule settings?\*\***

Currently, there's no built-in export feature for recording schedules:

- Settings are stored locally on the device

- Manual recreation required when switching devices

- Consider screenshots of current reminders for reference during device transfers

---
