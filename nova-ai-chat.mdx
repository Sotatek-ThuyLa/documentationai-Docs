  Nova AI Chat is a smart assistant integrated into NoteX, designed to help
  users deeply explore AI-processed content from various formats—recordings,
  documents, images, and web links.
  Once the notes are generated by AI, Nova becomes your main tool to ask
  questions, extract information, and generate new content quickly and
  effectively.
