## **4. FAQ**

---

### **What tabs can I hide?**

You can hide all tabs **except Summary**. Hidden tabs won’t appear in your Note Details but their data is still saved in the background.

---

### **Will changes apply to old notes?**

Yes. Your tab layout will apply to **all existing and future notes** after tapping Save.

---

### **What if I accidentally remove a tab?**

Just tap the tab again in the **All Tabs** section — it will be re-added at the bottom of your Note Tabs list.

---

### **Can I reset to default?**

Currently, there is no “reset” button. You’ll need to manually re-add the default tabs if you want to restore them.

---

### **Does this sync across devices?**

Yes — if you're signed in to the same account on all devices, your layout will sync automatically.

---

### **What is the Summary tab and why can’t I remove it?**

The **Summary** tab is a required core component of NoteX. It is always included in every note and cannot be hidden or moved.

---

### **Will hiding a tab delete its data?**

No. Hidden tabs simply disappear from the UI. The data is still safely stored and will reappear if you re-enable the tab.
