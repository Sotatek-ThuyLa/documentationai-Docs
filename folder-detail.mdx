---

### **What's the difference between the Folders section and All Notes section?**

The Folders section shows other folders inside this one, while All Notes shows individual notes. You can hide either section if you don't need to see it.

Tap the "+" button at the top and type in what you want to call your new folder.

---

Yes! Tap the three-dot menu next to any item and choose "Edit Name" to change what it's called.

### **What happens if I delete a folder that has notes in it?**

The app will ask if you want to keep the notes (and move them somewhere else) or delete everything together.

---

### **How do I stop selecting multiple items?**

Tap the "Cancel" button at the top right, or use the back button to return to normal viewing.

---

### **Why do folders and notes have different menu options?**

Each type of item has actions that make sense for it. Folders can have notes added to them, while individual notes can be exported or shared.
